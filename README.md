Connect four game in scheme

This program was a project for my class. The goal was to create a program which could be run to take turns putting chips into different columns like the actual game,
and create some sort of AI to make the best move and win against the component. I did not completely finish the NRAWinP function, because I ran out of time. It 
is able to detect when there is a winning move on a vertical column, but not when the win is with a diagonal or horizontal.
My "AI" is not very sophisticated, it simply puts the chip in the first column not compltely filled. This is because in our class tournament I suspect a lot of
the programs mine will be facing their AIs will be assuming the opponent is making good plays. So it may be tripped up by mine and make a win easy.
There is no main program to run this, it was requested we simply create the functions for the game to be played.
